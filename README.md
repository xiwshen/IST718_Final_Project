# Description

Based on the course requirements, this project was finished by using PySpark. All the codes were written and executed in the Google Colab environment. The folder "data_group5" 
contains the data files that were used for this project. In order to run the code, the data folder should be downloaded and saved to Google Drive, then load the data from 
Google Drive to the Colab environment.

For this Project, we devided our codes into two separate notebooks. The "IST718_Final_Project_EDA_Group5.ipynb" is used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, which does not 
involve any use of PySpark. The second notebook called "IST718_Final_Project_Models_Group5.ipynb", which contains all the models we have built for making predictions, including 
Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees.
